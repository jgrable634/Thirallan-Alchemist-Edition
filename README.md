# Thirallan-Alchemist-Edition
This mod is a kind of collection of my other mods, except they have all been redone to be much better mods. All into one star system. Are you ready to experience what these mods should've been like from the start?

There are a few things to note currently:

1. Speak to CaptAln after meeting him, or speak to Alchemist after making the Dragon Ship to unlock the system.

2. The mods that have been redone in this mod are as follows:

Thirallan, The Realm of Dragons, Deathbourne, Robot Rebellion, and a completely new project.

3. This mod is currently incomplete, the following things are either nonexistent or inaccessible at this current time:

Realm of Dragons, Some of Thirallan, Deathbourne, and the new project.

4. There is a placeholder sprite: the Farmer Scene Sprite is a placeholder for the character: Pyrrhos.

5. This mod was originally created for the KOZ Modding Competition.
